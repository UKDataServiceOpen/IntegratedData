## Plan of the presentation

::: {.notes}
Hello and welcome to this presentation by the UK DS
My name is Pierre Walthéry, I work at the traning and user support wing of UKDS
Today I would like to talk about three main topics
:::

1.  Most common surveys with integrated data
2.  Typical data integrated with surveys
3.  Accessing secure integrated datasets

# Introduction

Integrated data:

-   When we add non survey data to survey data

    -   Whether part of the original data collection or not
    -   Whether primary or secondary
    -   Whether same unit of analysis or not
    -   Validation or enhancement (Benzeval et al 2020)

-   Typically: administrative, biometric, social media data

    - Accelerometer, genetic data, individual NHS or PAYE records...

-   This talk mostly deals with integrated data *available at the UK Data Service*

# Part 1

![](pics/part_1.png){fig-alt="Section title with icons: What are the surveys with integrated data?"}

## Overview

-   Depends on:

    -   The topic covered by the  data linked i.e. does it match common topics studied in surveys?
    -   The survey itself (i.e. does it include the required linking information / user consent)
    -   ... Scope of the surveys i.e. is linkage part of the original data collection,  or is it a subsequent project?

-   Major longitudinal studies:

    -   For a variety of reasons - more straightforward
    -   Birth cohort studies
    -   Next Steps and ELSA
    -   Understanding Society

-   A few large scale cross-sectional surveys such as:

    -   ASHE (Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings)
    -   Family Resources Survey
    -   Scottish Health Survey (project)


## Birth cohort studies

-   Follow a sample of individuals\* over their whole life
-   Born during  a specific period of 1958(NCDS), 1970(BCS), 2000 (MCS), 2026 (?)
-   MCS
    -   \~ 19,000 children  (born between June 2001 and Jan 2003)
    -   7 'sweeps' 9 months then at 3, 5, 7, 11, 14, years old
    -   parent and child interviews
    -   Focuses on education, skills and health, truancy, cognitive ability, biological measurements 
    -   ... In addition to traditional socio-economic and demographic data

## Understanding Society

-   The largest longitudinal study representative of the UK population
-   Initial sample size: 40K households, 100K individuals
-   14 waves so far: 2009-23; includes BHPS data 1991-02
-   Ethnic minority boost samples; Innovation Panel
-   Very wide range of topics covered:

    -   Employment, income, benefits, savings, debt, and assets
    -   Health, well-being, and health behaviours
    -   Housing, housing costs, and dwelling characteristics
    -   Family, partnerships, caring responsibilities,
    -   Education, training
    -   Expenditure, consumption, deprivation
    -   Social attitudes, values, political opinions
    -   Transport, mobility, and commuting patterns
    -   Environmental behaviours, and related attitudes

## Other studies

- Next Steps (formerly Longitudinal Study of Young People in England - LSYPE): 

  - 16,000 people in England born 1980-90, from secondary school age (i.e. 13-14) onwards; 
  - Initially set up by DfE to examine determinants of school achievement

- ELSA (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing): 

  - Follows a sample of  19,000  people aged over 50 to understand all aspects of ageing in England. 
  - Started in 2002, biennial waves. 
  - Data on  physical and mental health (incl. well-being), financial circumstances, and attitudes about ageing.


# Part 2

![](pics/part_2.png){fig-alt="Section title with icons: What kind of non-survey data is  integrated   with UKDS surveys?"}

## Overview

-   Administrative records

    -   ie *data collected by a public ie state controlled authority*: government department, the NHS
    -   Health: NHS, SHS: medical records ie outpatient attendance, hospitalisation episodes, maternity
    -   Education: National Pupil Database, school profile/teacher survey; student loan data, OFSTED data
    -   Pollution; green space deciles; PAYE data

-   Non survey measurement: energy consumption, health, behavioural

-   Social media/digital trace

## What is on offer: examples
::: {.notes}
Let us now go through a few concrete example of linked data that can be accessed via the UK Data Service
:::

![](pics/admin.png){.absolute top="100" left="50" width="250" fig-alt="Image representing administrative data"} ![](pics/edu.png){.absolute top="400" left="50" width="250" fig-alt="Image representing educational data"} ![](pics/hlt.png){.absolute top="100" left="400" width="250" fig-alt="Image representing health data"} ![](pics/paye.png){.absolute top="400" left="400" width="350" fig-alt="Image representing PAYE data"}

## 1. Genetic risk data

-   Polygenic scores (PGI) about health and social outcomes
-   Probability of some outcomes given someone's genetic traits

    -   A vector of probabilities attached to respondents' record according to their their genetic information 
    -   45 traits: ie health outcomes and behaviour; mental health and personality traits; Social outcomes
    -   Available on the birth cohorts studies,  ELSA & Next Steps
    -   Subsamples limited to genetic 'Europeans'

## 5. Studies deposited on ReShare
::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](pics/reshare1.png){fig-alt: "Screenshot from the output of a search on the UK Data Service catalogue"}

![](pics/reshare2.png){fig-alt: "Screenshot of a study deposited via ReShare on the UKDS website "}
:::

- Example: data about property characteristics linked to transaction ie price  data
- 5,732,838 transactions in England and Wales, 79% of the total between 2011 and 2019,

::: {.notes}
- So far I have mentioned large scale longitudinal studies. I also need to mention another kind of data held at UK Data Service: ReShare. 
- Anyone who produces ESRC-funded data is required to have it deposited with the UKDS
- Some of these studies include linked data.
- This particular dataset links the Land Registry Price Paid Data (PPD) with property size information from the official open Domestic Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs).
- Enables more detailed, richer analysis of the housing market and property purchases.
:::

# Part 3

::: {.notes}

- So far I have talked about the data that we hold, but it is also interesting to know how to access it.
- The majority of linked data - exception of housing transactions) is highly sensitive, contains personal information at risk of disclosure according to GDPR.
- Special, restricted conditions of access have been set out in order to protect the anonymity of respondents.

## Safe researcher training

The course we recognise as valid for SecureLab access is the *Safe Researcher training (SRT) course* which covers:

-   *Data security and personal responsibility* including legal background, security model, breaches and penalties.

-   *Statistical Disclosure Control* – how to make statistical outputs safe and which principles are used.

-   *Using the SecureLab* – how to use the interface and how to prepare and request data imports and suitable statistical outputs

## Secure access user agreement

-   Legally binding contract between the user, their organisation and the University of Essex

-   It is a per person, per organisation agreement.

-   Outlines the T&Cs of use of Secure Lab and includes:

    -   The  user will complete the mandatory SRT training.
    -   Information about the  user’s security responsibilities.
    -   Information about penalties and breaches
    -   Our outputs release policy.
    -   Our citation and copyright requirements.
