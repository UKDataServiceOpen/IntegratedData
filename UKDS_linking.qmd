## Plan of the presentation

1. Most common surveys  with integrated data
2. Typical data integrated with surveys
3. Accessing secure integrated datasets


# Introduction

Integrated data:

- When we add non survey data to survey data

  - Whether part of the original data collection or not
  - Whether primary or secondary 
  - Whether same unit of analysis or not
  - Validation or enhancement (Benzeval et al 2020)

- Typically: administrative, biometric, social media data
- Examples: accelerometer, genetic data, individual NHS or PAYE records...  
- This talk mostly deals with integrated data *available at the UK Data Service* 

# Part 1
![](pics/part_1.png){fig-alt="Section title with icons: What are the surveys with integrated data?"}



## Overview

- Depends on:

  - The kind of data linked to the surveys ie mainstream topic, availability...
  - The survey itself (i.e. does it include  the required linking information / user consent)
  - ... Scope of the surveys ie is linkage part of the original data collection , was it intended or is it a post hoc project?
  - For a variety of reasons - more straightforward

- Major longitudinal studies:

  - Birth Cohort studies
  - Next Steps and ELSA
  - Understanding Society
  
- A few large scale cross-sectional  surveys such as:

  - ASHE (Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings)
  - Health Survey for England
  - Family Resources Survey

## Birth cohort studies

- Follow a sample of individuals*  over their whole life
- Born on a specific week of 1958(NCDS), 1970(BCS), 1989-90 (Next Steps), 2000 (MCS), 2026 (?)
- MCS 
  - ~ 19,000 children originally (between June 2001 and Jan 2003)
  - 7 'sweeps' 9 months then at 3, 5, 7, 11, 14, years old
  - parent and child interviews
  - Focuses on education, skills and health, truancy, cognitive ability biological measurements in additional to traditional socio-economic data
  
## Understanding Society

- The largest  longitudinal study representative of the UK population
- Initial sample size: 40K households, 100K individuals
- 14 waves so far: 2009-23; includes BHPS data 1991-02
- Ethnic minority boost samples; Innovation Panel
- Very wide range of topics covered:

  - Employment, income, benefits, savings, debt, and assets
  - Health, well-being, and health behaviours
  - Housing, housing costs, and dwelling characteristics
  - Family, partnerships, caring responsibilities,
  - Education, training
  - Expenditure, consumption, deprivation
  - Social attitudes, values, political opinions
  - Transport, mobility, and commuting patterns
  - Environmental behaviours, and related attitudes

# Part 2
![](pics/part_2.png){fig-alt="Section title with icons: What kind of non-survey data is  integrated   with UKDS surveys?"}


## Overview 

- Administrative records
 
  - ie data collected by a public ie the state controlled authority: government department, the NHS
  - Health: NHS SHS: medical records ie in/outpatient attendance hospital episodes, maternity
  - Education: National Pupil Database, school profile/teacher survey; student loan data, OFSTED data
  - Pollution; green space deciles; PAYE data
- Non survey measurement: energy, health, behavioural
- Social media/Digital trace

## 1. Genetic risk data

- Polygenic scores (PGI) about health and social outcomes
- Gene combinations associated with probability of certain outcomes  

  - 45 traits: ie health outcomes and behaviour; mental health and personality traits; Social outcomes
  
  - Available on the  Birth Cohorts and Next Steps datasets
  
  - Subsamples limited to 'Europeans' from a genetic perspective
